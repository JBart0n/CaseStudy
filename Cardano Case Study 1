Cardano is a [proof-of-stake](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp) blockchain platform that says its goal is to allow “changemakers, innovators and visionaries” 
to bring about positive global change. The open-source project also aims to “redistribute power from unaccountable structures to the margins to individuals” helping to create a society that is more secure, transparent, and fair. Cardano is the first to be founded on peer-reviewed research and developed through based methods.

Cardano was funded by the [Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/) from an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). The Cardano Foundation raised a total of $62M in funding over 4 rounds. The platform began development in 2015 and was launched in 2017 by founder Charles Hoskinson, who was also one of the co-founders of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) network. He is the CEO of [IOHK](https://iohk.io/), the company that built Cardano’s blockchain, with the aim to “provide a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem for Cryptocurrencies”.  According to Cardano’s website its native crypto-currency [ADA](https://www.coindesk.com/price/cardano/) is the only coin with a “scientific philosophy and research driven approach”. 

Cardano’s purpose is to provide a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem for 
crypto currencies in the future to help work better together, trust one another, and build global solutions to global problems. 

>“Cardano began with a vision of a world without intermediaries, in which power is not controlled by an accountable few, but by the empowered many. In this world individuals have control over their data and how they interact and transact. Businesses have the opportunity to grow independent of monopolistic and bureaucratic power structures. Societies are able to peruse true democracy: self-governing, fair, and accountable. It is a world made possible by Cardano” 

### Partners 
---
A decentralized team works across three independent entities to ensure that Cardano stays true to its purpose as we advance and evolve. The following companys have thier own speific role

### **Cardano Foundation:** 
 The [Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/) is a blockchain and cryptocurrency organisation based in Zug, Switzerland.Representing Cardano’s positive development of the blockchain community, supporting people who are interested in Cardano. The main role is to work with policy-makers, governments, and countries to push innovative technology.

### **Input-Output Hong Kong:** 

[IOHK](https://iohk.io/) is an organization founded by Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood, which is focused on building technological solutions that aim to promote better financial inclusion. Responsible for technologies behind the Cardano blockchain. Numerous engineers are continuously researching and developing infrastructure and Smart Contract on Cardano. Moreover, they come up with blockchain solutions for public, private communities, and government clients. By collaborating with other companies, they are expanding influence quickly.
### **Emurgo:** 
 A Japanese company, [Emurgo](https://emurgo.io/) is a worldwide initiative designed to support developers, startups and enterprises in developing blockchain solutions. It is considered the sister company of IOHK. It actively supports companies, businesses and has invested in many startups including Cardano.

Cardano’s mission is to create a universal system that is open, decentralised and resistant to being tampered with.  Aiming to take the world from a split system to a unified system, bringing the developing world up to the developed world, to have 7 billion people living and operating under one financial operating system so that your identity is interoperable and universal, with principles focused on putting you in charge of your money, your identity and your voice with governance “so that the richest people in the world use the same system as the poorest people in the world and both of those people will have a better system than the one that came before, that’s what Cardano is trying to accomplish.” 

Cardano is a developing platform being built to accommodate a broad range of use cases, solving problems across multiple industries. 

| Education: | Credential Verification |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Retail: | Product Counterfeiting |  
| Agriculture: | Supply Chain Tracking |
|Government: | Digital Identity| 
|Finance: | Onboarding|
|Health Care: | Counterfeit Medication| 

Cardano aims to provide a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem that better accounts for the needs of its users as well as other systems seeking integration. The first generation of blockchains offered decentralized ledgers for secure cryptocurrency transfers. As blockchain technology matured, the second generation provided more enhanced solutions for smart contracts, application development, and the creation of different token types. On the other hand, the second generation of blockchains often faces issues in terms of scalability. Cardano is a third generation blockchain that combines prior generations and evolves to meet the arising needs of the users

To address these needs Cardano Focuses on concepts such as:

##  Scalability 
Ensures that the Cardano ledger can process many transactions without affecting network performance.

## Interoperability 
Ensures the most functional environment for financial, business, or commercial operations by enabling users to interact not only with one type of currency, but with multiple currencies across various blockchains.

## Sustainability 
Designing a proof-of-stake blockchain means it is vital to ensure that the system is self-sustainable. To drive grow in a truly decentralized manner, the community is responsible to maintain its continuous development by participating, proposing, and implementing system improvements.

# Advantages 

- ### Academic research 
Cardano has been built using formal methods to achive strong guarantees on the functional correctness of core components of the system
- ### System design 
Written in the functional language Haskell, it uses pure functions to build the system, where components can be tested in isolation.
- ### Security
Ouroboros (the Cardano proof-of-stake protocol) establishes rigorous security guarantees
- ### Power Consumption
Proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains use far less energy and computational power than proof-of-work (PoW)
- ### Seamless upgrades
Blockchains upgrade using hard forks, when conducting hard forks the protocol would stop operating, new rules and changes would be made and the chain would restart, erasing its previous history. Cardano hard fork combinator technology ensure no disruptions for users while transitioning to a new protocol while saving the history of previous blocks
- ### Decentralization 
Cardano is maintained by almost 3,000 distributed stake pools that are operated by the community. All blocks and transactions are validated by network participants without any reliance on a centralized authority.
- ###	Functional environment for business use cases 
Cardano is establishing a foundation for global, decentralized finance to develop a range of decentralised applications (DApps) that can run using functional and domain-specific smart contracts, providing multi-asset tokens for any needs.






>"Cardano actually does the things that we’ve always wanted to do in cryptocurrencies, which is build a financial operating system for people who don’t have one—one that actually can compete with a global financial system." -  Charles Hoskinson

The Blockchain and Crypto Currency’s industry has evolved fast and seen a lot of innovation in the last 5-10 years, starting as a distributed database to becoming a globally distributed cloud computer.  The evolution of Blockchain has been broken into Generations.


## Generation 1
### Money Transactions 
Single application blockchains without the ability to communicate.  

*E.g: Bitcoin, Litecoin*

## Generation 2 
### Smart Contracts, Assets management and Tokens 
A Single blockchain in which developers could build applications.

*E.g: Ethereum, NEO*

## Generation 3 
### Scalability, Sustainability and Interoperability 
An internet of blockchains that can communicate with each other, focusing on 
Decentralised Applications (dApps)

*E.g: Cardano, IOTA*

**Cardano  and has outlined its plans for the development of the platform. There are five eras that will consist of each phase of Cardano’s blockchain development, namely: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho and Voltaire. Each phase will focus on a specific functionality related to the goal of the platform.**

![](https://file.publish.vn/amberblocks/2021-09/cardano-roadmap-1631345845692.jfif)
## Byron / Foundation Establishment

Byron set the foundation for Cardano development allowing users to buy and sell ADA on a proof-of-stake blockchain network.

## Shelley / Decentralization

The Shelley development theme introduced a decentralized ledger creating a completely new economic system, shifting away from the federated Byron era to more of a reliance on community-run nodes. This era also saw the introduction of delegation and incentivization schemes.

## Goguen / Smart Contracts
Goguen development brought smart contracts focusing on the establishment of a global, financial and multi-functional system for decentralized application building, smart contract support, and custom token issuance. Goguen is a key building block to establish a versatile platform to build solutions around such application domains as supply chain, track and trace, finance, medical records, identity voting, property registration, P2P payments, and many others.

## Basho / Scalability
Basho will focus on improving the scalability and interoperability of the network. Where previous stages focused on decentralization and new functionality, Basho is about improving the performance and stability of the Cardano network to better support growth and adoption for applications with high transaction volume.

## Voltaire / Governance
Voltaire is designed as the final era of Cardano. Decentralized governance and decision making lie at the heart of Voltaire granting the Cardano community an ability to vote on network development updates, technical improvements, and project funding. For the Cardano network to become truly decentralized, it requires not only the distributed infrastructure introduced during Shelley but also the capacity to be maintained and improved over time in a decentralized way

Cardano is an ambition project, but is still an unproven and has not yet been tested in full unlike competitor  platforms.
Cardano puts forward an impressive plan and long-term vision for its blockchain and cryptocurrency but it is still early days, many of which are yet to be implemented. 
Many of the claims Cardano makes are theoretical as the blockchain is still developing. While its initial use case is as a cryptocurrency, Cardano’s blockchain intends to expand beyond coins into a control layer that will provide services absent in the cryptocurrency ecosystem today. Given that it is still early days, much depends on their execution of the vision.

Over the years, the Cardano team has missed multiple deadlines on its roadmap, taking a deliberately slow route and forgoing the 1st mover advantage Ethereum had. Given Cardano is a 3rd generation blockchain it’s hard to fault and find suggestions for improvement. They had the advantage of seeing issues within the domain and made implementations to meet the arising needs of the User and resolve pervious issues the User encountered to ensure long-lasting future for Cardano. 

Despite the many benefits of Cardano experts state that demand for ADA is low, since the team hasn’t yet implemented a lot of projects due to incomplete smart-contract and token standards, So, it’s still hard to use for people who want to run their Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and implement asset tokenization, this is one of Cardano main issues and why Cardano is losing its position among its main competitors Ethereum and Solana
